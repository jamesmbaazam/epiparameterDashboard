This dashboard provides a quick way to visualise the epidemiological parameters
stored in the [epiparameter R package](epiverse-trace/epiparameter)).

The dashboard is intended to reduce the barrier of entry for those interested in
exploring epidemiological parameters. <br/>It is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, allowing users to select a disease and an epidemiological parameter <br/>to visualise.

If the user is satisfied with the visualised parameter, they can copy the
citation for the parameter directly from the "citation" <br/> field of the dashboard.

This dashboard is a proof of concept. If you have any feedback, please feel free
to open an issue or discussion on the <br/> package's [GitHub repository](github.com/jamesmbaazam/epiparameterDashboard).
