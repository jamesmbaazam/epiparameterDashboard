{{ packagename }} provides a dashboard to explore the database of epidemiological parameters
provided by the [epiparameter](epiverse-trace/epiparameter) package.

## Demo

You can access the deployed dashboard [here](https://james-mba-azam.shinyapps.io/epiparameterdashboard/).

Alternatively, you can run with the following code in your R console. It will download the app and run it in your browser.

```r
# Install the shiny package if not already installed
if (!require("shiny")) install.packages("shiny")
# Download and launch the dashboard
shiny::runGitHub("epiparameterDashboard", "jamesmbaazam")
```

This package is currently a *concept*, as defined by the [RECON software
lifecycle](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html). This means that essential
features and mechanisms are still being developed, and the package is not ready
for use outside of the development team.

### Contributions
